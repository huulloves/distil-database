# distil "track functionality"
`track()` â€” the functionality that allows users to identify implicit trends and connections between data and datasets.

- detects implicit patterns, trends, and anomalies
- links across datasets and data sources
- establishes temporal, categorical, or correlative threads
- uncovers relationships not directly observable in raw data
- supports discovery of hidden structures and dependencies

## definitions
- **implicit pattern:** a relationship or trend not directly visible but inferred from the data
- **anomaly:** a data point or pattern that deviates from the expected norm
- **thread:** a sequence or connection linking related data points across time, categories, or datasets

## potential function signature

```python
def track(data, context=None, method='auto') -> dict:
    """
    tracks implicit trends, patterns, and connections in the provided data
    - data: the dataset or collection of datasets to analyze
    - context: optional context or user preferences for tracking
    - method: tracking approach (`auto`, `temporal`, `categorical`, `correlative`)
    returns: a dictionary of discovered threads, patterns, and anomalies
    """
```

## inputs
- `data`: the dataset or collection of datasets to be tracked
- `context`: (optional) user or application context for personalized tracking
- `method`: (optional) tracking approach or algorithm to use

## outputs
- returns a dictionary containing discovered threads, patterns, and anomalies

## edge case handling
- if data is empty, return an empty dictionary with note "no data to track"
- if no implicit patterns found, return dictionary with empty lists with note "no implicit relationships discovered"

## intended workflow
1. preprocess data: clean and validate the input data
2. select tracking method: determine the best approach based on data and context
3. analyze for implicit patterns: search for trends, anomalies, and connections
4. construct threads: link related data points across time, categories, or datasets
5. format output: organize findings into a structured dictionary

## high-level example
input:
- dataset: user activity logs across multiple platforms

output:
- {
    "temporal_threads": ["user a is least activity every morning between hours 8am and 2:55pm", "spike in platform b activity at 3pm"],
    "anomalies": ["user a login from new location", "user a failed login at 9am"],
    "correlations": ["leaving location a and after 3pm, user a sees increased engagment in platform b"]
  }

## extensibility

- add support for custom tracking algorithms
- allow user to specify focus areas (e.g., only anomalies, only correlations)
- integrate with visualization modules for thread mapping
