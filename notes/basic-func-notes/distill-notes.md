# distil "distill functionality"
`distill()` - the functionality that allows users to retrieve summarized tracked explicit and implicit trends, relationships, and other distilled information about the>
- synthesizes across all layers and functionalities
- merges output of summarize() and track() into a cohesive insight layer
- final presentation of explicit + implicit insights in a human-readable format
- refined undistorted clarity
- produces full-spectrum distilled information (position, dynamics, and mechanisms). semantics.

## definitions
- **explicit trend** - a directly observable pattern in the data
- **implicit trend** - a hidden or indirectly observable pattern in the data

## potential function signature

```python
def distill(data, filters=None, user_profile=None) -> str:
    """
    Synthesizes and presents distilled insights from the dataset.
    """
```

## inputs
- `data` - the dataset or query to be distilled
- `filters` - optional filiters to narrow focus of distillation
- `user_profile` - eventually ai-generated user_profile that provides user context for more personalized insights

## outputs 
- returns human-readable summary string or structured report

## edge case handling
- if no data, return "no trends or relationships found"
- if conflicting trends, return all trends AND note of uncertainty

## intended workflow 
1. retrieve and preprocess data.
2. call summarize() for explicit trends.
3. call track() for implicit relationships.
4. merge and synthesize results.
5. format for clarity and readability.

## high-level example
inputs:
- csv file containing all customer + all customer purchases over 12 months.
- user query stating "summarize current trends in presented data"
- ai-created profile stating "user is data analyst for a company that requires trend data split into quarters. user prefers high-level summary by default and will request more detailed infomration explicitly, so provide high-level summary and not detailed summary to start"

output:
"over the past year, purchases increased by 20%, with a notable shift toward online channels in Q3. returning customers drove 60% of sales, especially in urban regions."

## extensibility
- visualization support
- API integration?
