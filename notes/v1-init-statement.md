# distil database 'init statement'

## mission statement

to access, process, and distill datasets to empower end users to track and understand the data they seek

## inputs
user provided dataset. 
users will be able to input url of datasets of their choice into **distil**, the application will retrieve and download the set, store it in application memory for the user to query and question.

## process + functionalities
init - the functionality that allows users to inject **distil** with the dataset of their choice
- injects data into the system
- triggers dataset registration and memory mapping
- prepares for downstream operations
 
ask - the functionality that allows users to query/retrieve raw and past distilled information (at a high-level) from **distil**
- query interface
- returns in unaltered or lightly formatted state
- produces **positional** distilled information (location, frequency, category)

summarize - the funcitonality that allows users to retrieve summarized data, trends, and other distilled information and these informations will be presented in entirely human readable conversational language...will not necessarily contain tracked trends..just trends that are explicilty apparent in the dataset.
- converts raw or queried data into natural-language insight
- stripped of abstraction
- output is human-readable, contextualized, and high-level
- not dependent on tracker functionality

track - the functionality that allows users to identify implicit trends and connections between data and datasets.
- detects implicit patterns, trends, anomalies
- links across datasets
- establishes temporal, categorical, or correlative threads

distill - the functionality that allows users to retrieve summarized tracked explicit and implicit trends, relationships, and other distilled information about the dataset(s).
- synthesizes across all layers and functionalities
- merges output of summarize() and track() into a cohesive insight layer
- final presentation of explicit + implicit insights in a human-readable format
- refined undistorted clarity
- produces full-spectrum distilled information (position, dynamics, and mechanisms). semantics.

## intended output
a compressed knowledge artifact that is human-readable, logically sound and coherent, and pattern-aware.
- to reduce informational chaos into clear signals of insight and pattern.
