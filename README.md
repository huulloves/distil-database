# distil

**distil** is a local-first python tool built to connect to datasets and distill complex, quantified data into clear, human-readable insight ‚Äî in the user's voice, on their terms.

## purpose
**distil** helps anyone ‚Äî no matter their education or language level ‚Äî access and understand data in a way that makes sense to them. it doesn‚Äôt gatekeep info. it lets you ask questions, get summaries, and trace patterns, while honoring how *you* think and speak.

## üí° key features (planned)
- connect to local or downloaded datasets (csv, sqlite, more coming)
- summarize key patterns from the data in natural language
- adaptive language mode (starts at a1 and evolves with the user)
- configurable tone settings (encouraging, direct, reflective, etc.)
- time-based distillation (daily, weekly, monthly summaries)
- natural language q&a over any dataset
- runs locally ‚Äî no cloud, no spying, just you and your thoughts

## why it exists
most data tools assume you‚Äôre already a data expert. **distil** flips that. it says:

> *‚Äúif you care enough to ask, you deserve to understand.‚Äù*

most importantly, **distil** is a primary module for the aimee-notebook. 
the **distil** functionality of the aimee notebook will be made using *distil* logic and code.
that's the goal anyways.

this project centers:
- neurodivergent thinkers 
- non-native english speakers 
- curious minds without formal training 
- people looking for reflection, not overwhelm

## project status
this is early dev stage. core distillation logic and dataset handling are in progress. future plans include integrating a local ai model to interpret and reflect human thought more clearly.
