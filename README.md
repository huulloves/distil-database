# distil

**distil** is a local-first python tool built to connect to datasets and distill complex, quantified data into clear, human-readable insight — in the user's voice, on their terms.

## ✨ purpose

distil helps anyone — no matter their education or language level — access and understand data in a way that makes sense to them. it doesn’t gatekeep info. it lets you ask questions, get summaries, and trace patterns, while honoring how *you* think and speak.

## 💡 key features (planned)

- connect to local or downloaded datasets (csv, sqlite, more coming)
- summarize key patterns from the data in natural language
- adaptive language mode (starts at a1 and evolves with the user)
- configurable tone settings (encouraging, direct, reflective, etc.)
- time-based distillation (daily, weekly, monthly summaries)
- natural language q&a over any dataset
- runs locally — no cloud, no spying, just you and your thoughts

## why it exists

most data tools assume you’re already a data expert. distil flips that. it says:
> “if you care enough to ask, you deserve to understand.”

this project centers:
- neurodivergent thinkers 
- non-native english speakers 
- curious minds without formal training 
- people looking for reflection, not overwhelm

## project status

this is early dev stage. core distillation logic and dataset handling are in progress. future plans include integrating a local ai model to interpret and reflect human thought more clearly.
